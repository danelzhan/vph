                    <p>Tyler is a senior at R.E. Mountain Secondary School and is serving as the Executive Director of Vancouver Packages for Hope. During COVID, Tyler was researching the pandemic’s impacts on underprivileged populations—especially in our beautiful British Columbia—and developed a moral propensity to alleviate the economic struggles and food insecurities that were confronting our homeless communities. As a result, he started this initiative with his partner, Max Chen, who shared a similar vision - to provide hope to those who needed it the most through our care packages.</p>

                    <p>A senior at Steveston-London Secondary School, Chiune serves as the Director of Event Coordination at Vancouver Packages for Hope. Chiune’s drive for creating equality in an unequal world sprouts from his early endeavors as a child witnessing the cruelties of homelessness and drug abuse. He hopes with the help of his team, to make any slightest difference he can. At VPH, Chiune foresees planning, managing, and executing different events. From organizing fundraiser locations and package distribution sites to nitpicking volunteers to act accordingly, Chiune actively takes part in the logistical field and spends time on the “front lines” aiding the homeless community. With his efforts to support those who carry the burden of lower socioeconomic status, Chiune hopes to inspire others in the fight against poverty and help in any way he can.                    </p>
