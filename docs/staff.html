                    <h2>Tyler Sun | Executive Director of Operations</h2>
                    <p>Tyler is a senior at R.E. Mountain Secondary School and is serving as the Executive Director of Vancouver Packages for Hope. During COVID, Tyler was researching the pandemic’s impacts on underprivileged populations—especially in our beautiful British Columbia—and developed a moral propensity to alleviate the economic struggles and food insecurities that were confronting our homeless communities. As a result, he started this initiative with his partner, Max Chen, who shared a similar vision - to provide hope to those who needed it the most through our care packages.</p>

                    <p>Currently a junior at Steveston-London Secondary School, Max is exhilarated to serve as the Director of the Walt Disney Company at CAHSMUN 2024. Since beginning his Model United Nations journey three years ago, he became allured by meeting various delegates, memorable moments, and late-night conversations with his roommates. Outside of MUN, he can be found talking to his imaginary “Chat”, scrolling through cat and otter photos on Instagram, nodding and pretending he understands things people say (he still does not), and following three core tenets: Gaslight, Gatekeep, Girlboss. Max looks forward to meeting everyone for a weekend filled with magical debate and wishes every delegate the best of luck!</p>
